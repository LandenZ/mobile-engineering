Here is my submission for the programming challenge.  Here are some assumptions and things I would like to note.
1. Application does not support rotation, I saw that the native living social app does not rotate so did not think it
was a requirement.
2. I assumed showing the deal would be useful which is why i added a UIWebView as the detail page to the master view
3. This app is best viewed on iPhones, it works on an iPad but it does not style it differently. Just looks like a big
iPhone.  
4. The data coming from the webservice seemed like deal information which is why I call the table Deal List and the 
details just Deals.
5. Since the application does not have to persist data then I also figured that the data is not refreshed frequently 
which is why it does not check the webservice more than just on startup.
